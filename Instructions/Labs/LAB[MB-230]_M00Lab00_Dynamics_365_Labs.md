# Practice Lab - Validate lab environment & provision trials

## Scenario

In this Module 0 lab, you will provision a Dynamics 365 Customer Service Trial. You will access your individual credentials, provision the trial, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. It is also necessary to provision a Customer Voice Trial to be used later in the course.

**Important notice for instructors and students:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
